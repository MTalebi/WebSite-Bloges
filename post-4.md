# Why do design codes introduce *cracking coefficients*?

Before diving in, ask yourself two key questions:

1. What problem are the **cracking coefficients** in the codes actually simplifying?
2. When we switch to the "standard" nonlinear analyses recommended by regulations such as **ASCE 41**, do these coefficients still matter?

If your answer is **yes**, you may wonder:

> Then what extra benefit does nonlinear analysis bring? Don't moment–curvature $M\text{–}\phi$ curves already capture concrete cracking at moments below the plastic moment?

## 1. Definition of the Cracking Coefficient

Consider a single reinforced-concrete section subjected to a given load combination. With a fiber analysis in **SAP2000**, **ETABS**, **OpenSees**, … you can quickly obtain its $M\text{–}\phi$ diagram (Figure 1).

> **Cracking coefficient** ($k_{\text{cr}}$) is defined as the ratio of the *effective stiffness* at that load to the *gross* (un-cracked, reinforcement-ignored) stiffness of the section:
>
>  
> $$
k_{\text{cr}} = \frac{\displaystyle \frac{M}{\phi} \bigl|_{\text{current load}}}{E_c I_g}
> $$

- $M$ Current bending moment
- $\phi$ Curvature at $M$ (slope of the line from the origin to the point $M,\phi$ on the curve)
- $E_c I_g$ Gross stiffness of the un-cracked concrete section

At service-level combinations (i.e., those **designed not to drive the section beyond yield**), Eq. (1) fully describes how much cracking degrades stiffness.

## 2. How Codes Use $k_{\text{cr}}$ in Linear and Non-Linear Models

- **Linear analysis** in most codes replaces the gross stiffness with

$$
  E_c I_{\text{eff}} = k_{\text{cr}} E_c I_g
$$

to mimic cracking in the *pre-yield* range.
- **Conventional nonlinear analyses** (the bilinear plastic-hinge models in ASCE 41 or Publication 360) **do _not_** track the curved part of the $M\text{–}\phi$ relation explicitly; they adopt a *single effective stiffness* up to yield.
- You may omit $k_{\text{cr}}$ **only if** your element model already includes the full bilinear (or multi-linear) pre-yield behavior.
- Because $k_{\text{cr}}$ varies with moment,
- $k_{\text{cr}}=1$ for $M < M_{\text{cr}}$ (un-cracked)
- $k_{\text{cr}}<1$ for $M_{\text{cr}} \le M < M_p$ where $M_{\text{cr}}$ is the cracking moment and $M_p$ is the plastic moment.

## 3. Code-Specified Values (Ultimate-Strength Combinations)

Design codes often assume that ultimate combinations *ideally* push each section up to its plastic resistance. Under that assumption, **ACI 318-19** gives the fixed factors in the following Table.

^caption: Table 6.6.3.1.1 (a) — Moments of Inertia and Cross-Sectional Areas Permitted for Elastic Analysis at Factored-Load Level (ACI 318-19)
| Member / Condition         | Moment of Inertia | Cross-Sectional Area for Axial Deformations | Cross-Sectional Area for Shear Deformations |
|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Columns                   | $0.70 I_g$        | —                                        | —                                           |
| Walls – **Uncracked**     | $0.70 I_g$        | $1.0 A_g$                                 | $b_w h$                                     |
| Walls – **Cracked**       | $0.35 I_g$        | —                                        | —                                           |
| Beams                     | $0.35 I_g$        | —                                        | —                                           |
| Flat plates & flat slabs  | $0.25 I_g$        | —                                        | —                                           |

ACI 318 also introduces an **alternative** (strain-based) method with variable factors (Table 6.6.3.1.1 (b) in the code). Current software seldom supports that approach in everyday practice.

## 4. Service-Load Combinations

For service combinations (concrete and steel limited to $0.6f_c'$), the allowable bending capacity can be found, and Eq. (1) reused. ACI recommends a shortcut:

$$
k_{\text{cr, service}} \approx 1.4k_{\text{cr, ultimate}}
$$

---

## 5. Key Takeaways

- **Cracking coefficients are a shortcut** that fold the curved portion of the $M\text{–}\phi$ diagram into a single "effective" stiffness.
- They remain relevant in many "standard" nonlinear analyses because those hinge models start at yield.
- You may skip them **only** when your model explicitly includes the bilinear pre-yield branch.
- For beams, **$k_{\text{cr}}\approx0.35$** at ultimate; for columns under axial load, **$k_{\text{cr}}\approx0.70$** (ACI 318-19).
- Service-load factors can be taken as roughly **1.4 × ultimate**.
