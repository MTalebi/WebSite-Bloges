# Scenario

You are a structural engineer assessing the condition of a building structure. You suspect that the building might be damaged due to external factors. To investigate, you conduct a vibration test on the building. You want to calculate the probability that the building is actually damaged given that the vibration test result indicates damage.

# Given Information

- **Prior knowledge:** Historically, only 5% of buildings in your region have experienced significant damage.
- **Vibration test accuracy:** The vibration test has an accuracy of 90%, meaning it correctly identifies damage 90% of the time.

# Perspectives

1. **Percy Pessimist:** Percy believes that if the test indicates damage, it's highly likely that the building is damaged, even if only a small percentage of buildings historically experienced damage.
2. **Opal Optimist:** Opal considers the test's potential for errors and believes that the building might not be damaged despite the test result. She thinks the high accuracy might not be perfect.
3. **Fin Frequentist:** Fin uses data to calculate the likelihood of observing a positive test result given a damaged building. He concludes that the building is likely to be damaged due to the high test accuracy.
4. **Ben Bayesian:** Ben uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the building is not highly likely to be damaged, given a positive test result. He combines test accuracy with prior knowledge to do so.

# Ben's Bayesian Approach

- Ben uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the building being damaged given a positive test result:

$ P(\text{Building Damaged} | \text{Positive Test Result}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05} {0.15}=0.30 $

$ P(\text{Positive Test Result})=0.05\cdot0.90+0.95\cdot0.1=0.15 $

From Ben's perspective, considering prior knowledge about buildings in this region, it is not highly probable to say that the building is damaged.

If we have no prior knowledge about the buildings in the region, or if we ignore the prior knowledge, we could assume a uniform probability (0.5) of having damaged or undamaged buildings in the region (Fin's perspective).

$ P(\text{Positive Test Result})=0.5\cdot0.90+0.5\cdot0.1=0.5 $

$ P(\text{Building Damaged} | \text{Positive Test Result}) = \frac{P(\text{Positive Test Result} | \text{Building Damaged}) \cdot 0.5} {0.5}$

$=P(\text{Positive Test Result} | \text{Building Damaged})=0.9$

That is why Fin believes that the building is likely to be damaged due to the 90% accuracy of the test.
